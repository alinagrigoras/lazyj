	The template framework. {@link lazyj.page.BasePage} is used to load a template from disk (or memory) and fill it with dynamic values. By default
	the parsed templates are cached, but you can explicitly disable this behavior (in the application development phase). Dynamic values
	can be processed by functions, that in the code are implementations of {@link lazyj.page.StringFormat}. Please check the description of
	BasePage and the <a href="tags/package-summary.html">lazyj.page.tags</a> package for more details.
