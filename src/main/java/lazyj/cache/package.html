	Content cache management classes. {@link lazyj.cache.Cache} provides a holding place for all general available data caches, refreshing 
	each of them at the desired rate. You can register {@link lazyj.cache.CacheElement} objects in this repository or make use of them 
	internally in your code. See the several (abstract) implementations of CacheElement for more functionality.
